# Vercel Configuration for RTW Rehab Provider Search

This file ensures Vercel uses the correct build and output settings for a Vite + React app.

```
# vercel.json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    { "src": "package.json", "use": "@vercel/static-build" }
  ],
  "routes": [
    { "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
```

- Place this file in the `website/` directory before deploying to Vercel.
- Vercel will run `npm run build` and serve the static files from `dist/`.
- All routes are redirected to `index.html` for client-side routing.
