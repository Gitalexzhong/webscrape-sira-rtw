## Features

- Interactive map with provider markers and grouped popups

- Search by address with geocoding and recent history
- Filter providers by company with 3-state toggle (normal, highlighted, hidden)
- List view of closest providers to searched location, with distances
- Favorites and hidden states persisted in localStorage
- Loading bar, floating search/filter bar, and clear UI affordances
- Responsive, compact, and accessible design
